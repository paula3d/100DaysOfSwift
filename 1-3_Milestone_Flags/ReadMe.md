# Flags

A first milestone project from the 100 Days of Swift course. 

## Challenge description

> Your challenge is to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view. When one of them is tapped, slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view, showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller, add an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name using UIActivityViewController.
